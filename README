    The name "rgang" and the original shell versions came from Marc Mengel;
    Kurt Ruthmansdorfer added to and modified the original versions; Jon
    Bakken added "copy mode"; and Ron Rechenmacher added the "nway" (including
    parallel execution) "tree structure" concepts.

                             PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
                             ===================
rgang is a tool which allows one to execute commands on or distribute files
to many nodes (computers). It incorporates an algorithm to build a tree-like
structure (or "worm" structure) to allow the distribution processing time to
scale very well to 1000 or more nodes.


Documentation
-------------
Documentation is included with the product/software. An online version can
be found at: https://github.com/fermitools/rgang

Required Hardware and Software
------------------------------
In the case that a "frozen" version of rgang does not work, users will need to
also have python.

Product Installation
--------------------
Copy the python script (<distdir>/bin/rgang.py) _or_
python "frozen" version (<distdir>/bin/rgang) to
  /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin or where every you
choose, renaming it to whatever you choose.

Note <distdir>/bin/rgang is the python "frozen" version of rgang.py.
It allows for the _possibility_ to run rgang on a system which does
not have python. So on systems with python, <distdir>/bin/rgang is not needed.
The "frozen" version may not work on your system due to incompatibilities
between it and the system that the frozen version was created on.

If the default "r" commands are not appropriate,
the python script can be modified OR a "pre-script"
created that sets the appropriate options
and then exec's the python script or
"frozen" version.  Example:
   #!/bin/sh
   # this script file can be named "rgang"
   exec python rgang.py --rsh=ssh --rcp=scp "$@"

Note: The bin/rgang executable is a python "froozen" version of rgang.py.
It allows for the _possibility_ to run rgang (bin/rgang) on a system which does
not have python. So on systems with python, bin/rgang is not needed. You could
just copy rgang.py to /usr/local/bin/rgang.


Running the Software
--------------------

                                   =======

Help with the installation or use of rgang is available by sending
mail to

                        rgang-support@fnal.gov

which is auto-forwarded to the group in charge of rgang support at
Fermilab.

This software is furnished by Fermilab on an "as is" basis as a service
to the wider community with the goal of stimulating collaborative use
and further development.

Provision of the software implies no commitment of support by Fermilab.

The Fermilab Computing Division is open to discussing other levels of
support for use of the software with responsible and committed users and
collaborators.

Use of the software in experiments at Fermilab will be assured of a
level of support as agreed to through the standard Memorandum Of
Understanding process.

Users may send mail to the mail address given above, with the
expectation that it will be read and noted.
